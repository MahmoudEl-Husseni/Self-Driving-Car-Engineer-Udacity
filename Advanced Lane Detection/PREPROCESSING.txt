1. convert from BGR to RGB.

L from LUV is a competitive candidate.
S from HLS is a competitive candidate.

test1: HLS -> S   | LUV -> V        | LAB -> B
test2: HLS -> S   | LUV -> (L, V)   | LAB -> (L, B)

Notes: 
1. blue ground -> better L in LUV, LAB.
2. B in LAB is more accurate than V in LUV.
3. Its important to first convert image from BGR to RGB.
==============================================
Conclusion: 
its better to use: Staturation from HLS, 
                    V from LUV,
                    B from LAB.

Apply prespective transform to combined image.
Apply sobel operators.
