Projects of Self-Driving Car Engineer Specialization from udacity

# P1: Line Detection:-
> In this model I have used traditional computer vision techniques (Color Thresholding, Canny edge detection, Hough Transform) to detect lane lines in roads.

# P2: MiniFlow:-
> In this project, I have designed simple computational graph module from scratch which can be used in deep learning projects

each graph can have one of 6 types of Nodes:
1. Input  (holds inputs) 
2. Add    (add several inputs)
3. Mul    (multiply several inputs)
4. sigmoid(apply sigmoid function to input)
5. Linear (multiply weight and input matrices then add bias)
6. MSE    (Calculate mean square error between tow vectors).
I have added some features for deeplearning training (ex. callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLronPlateau, LearningRateScheduler)

# P3: Traffic Signs Classification: 
> In this project, I have train a deeplearning model to classify images of traffic signs,<br> I have used LeNet Architecture to build this model,<br> I trained model on 43-classes of traffic signs.

# P4: Behavioral Cloning: 
> In this project, I have collected some labled images of roads and steering angles attached to each posistion using udacity car simulator,<br> I also have trained simple deeplearning model based on AlexNet to predict the suitable angle in each position.
